Code Challenge:

This should be a fairly simple challenge. Neatness, completeness, readability all count.
    Open lib/code_challenge and populate the function placeholder to make the tests pass
    Code must be pushed to a git repo. Provide the repo url.
    Complete as many challenges as possible.

  1. Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z.

  2. Write a function that determines the area of a circle given the radius.

  3. Write a function to add up all the values in an array.

  4. Write a function that determines if a string is a palindrome.

  5. Write a recursive function to determine the Nth Fibonacci Number in the Fibonacci sequence.

In the Fibonacci sequence, the first two numbers are 0 and 1 and each number after that is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. So, the sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. The '0' in the sequence is considered to be the 0th element, the first '1' is considered to be the 1st element, the 2 is the 3rd element, etc.

  1. Write a function that takes and array of numbers, multiplies each them their index, and writes it's values to a csv. The csv should have have 3 columns. index, number, and sum.

You can run test using:

```bash
$ ruby -Ilib:test test/test_code_challenge.rb
```
